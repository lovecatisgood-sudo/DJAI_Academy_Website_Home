# DJAI Academy Tool Feature List

This document inventories the tool features implemented in the repository. The codebase contains 32 main user-facing tools or workspaces:

- 1 QR-code tool
- 1 consolidated image-processing workspace
- 11 PDF tools
- 7 document-conversion tools
- 5 AI/context tools
- 7 spreadsheet/data tools

The image workspace also generates 11 task-specific entry pages. These pages use the same processing engine rather than separate implementations.

## 1. QR Code Generator

Routes:

- Thai: `/tools/qrgen/`
- English: `/tools/qrgen/en/`

Features:

- Converts a web address into a static QR code.
- Automatically adds `https://` when a domain is entered without a protocol.
- Validates HTTP and HTTPS destinations.
- Displays errors for invalid URLs.
- Updates the QR preview immediately when options change.
- Uses QR error-correction level `Q`.
- Provides square, rounded, and dot QR patterns.
- Provides square and extra-rounded corner styles.
- Provides eight preset QR colors.

- Downloads PNG or SVG output.
- Requires no registration and adds no watermark.
- Generates static codes that do not expire.
- Processes destination data locally in the browser.

Implementation note: the selected frame wraps the browser preview, while the current download function downloads the underlying QR object. The frame may therefore not be included in the downloaded file. SVG output is scalable; the configured raster QR size is 280 x 280 pixels.
